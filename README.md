ðŸš€ Internship Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection ðŸ’¡
Excited to share my latest project during my internship at Encryptix! I built a credit card fraud detection model using machine learning techniques to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions. This project honed my skills in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, contributing to more secure financial transactions.
